# Python books for libraries
## A list of Python books curated by NZPUG which are to be to be suggested to all NZ public libraries for their purchase and display as part of their non-fiction collections.

The Computing and Information Technology shelves in the Non-fiction sections of New Zealand libraries hold a variety of books about many general computing topic, programming being one of them. Each library has its own collections criteria so what one can find in one library catalog if very different to what can be found in another. That extends to Python programming books in New Zealand general libraries too.

## The Idea

To curate a NZPUG recommended list of Python books that would enable any member of the general public to pick up Python at a given point and progress in their understanding of Python from them on, just by moving from one book to another in the library's Python collecion.

## What needs to be done?

1. Design what this list might look like, what it should cover, how far should it go, how far should it enable people?
2. Explore lobbying like-minded organisations, such as Code Club Aotearoa (which already teaches Python using Raspberry Pi), in order to approach libraries jointly.
3. Explore whether we can get corporate sponsors who would help New Zealand libraries to purchase some of the books.

## What might come next?

1. Another curated Python boks list for school libraries with an integrated vision for primaries and secondaries (flow from one onto the other but still separate, age appropriate).
2. A Python programming curriculum and resources for New Zealand schools.
2. Another curated list for New Zealand Tertiary institutions.
