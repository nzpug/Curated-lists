# Curated-lists
## NZPUG Curated lists of Python resources 

## The Idea

To curate a NZPUG recommended list of Python resources that would enable any member of the general public to pick up Python at a given point and progress in their understanding of Python from then on, just by moving from one resource in a list to the next one.

## The Lists
-  Books-for-NZ-Libraries.md	
-  Online-Courses-and-MOOC
-  Online-reading-material
-  Printed-reading-material
